      '<div class="sa_div_scroll_text"><h3 class="sa_titulo_h3">Mesolex: SYLARD is an open access portal with two major goals:</h3><p>To provide Collaborators with a tool, SYLARD, that will generate from an ELAN file an HTML page with line-by-line playback of audio and any time-coded annotations.</p><p>To provide Visitors with a portal to this material, which would otherwise be difficult to access as it would require downloading sound and ELAN files from an archive, installing ELAN locally, and linking the ELAN file to the audio. This process is not friendly to non-specialized yet potentially interested parties.</p><h3 class="sa_titulo_h3">Registration</h3><p>The act of registration certifies that the Visitor or Collaborator has read and agreed to the Terms and Conditions below. Visitors and Collaborators are required to truthfully provide their first and last names, their email, and their country of origin. The first three items are used only to manage the account. The last item is to help the SYLARD administration understand the geographic distribution of registered individuals, data that will be useful for future funding requests. None of this data will be shared in any way and all statistics (e.g., geographic distribution) will be kept anonymous.</p><p>During registration Mesolex: SYLARD also gives Visitors and Collaborators the option of providing three additional sets of information: (1) a personal statement; (2) language(s) spoken; and (3) language(s) of interest (e.g., for research or as a heritage speaker). This information will only be used internally to better understand the nature of the audience that this portal is reaching and thus better plan future developments. All users are welcome to write directly to Mesolex at any time (mesolex.director@gmail.com). All exchanges are confidential.</p><h3 class="sa_titulo_h3">License and Use</h3><p>Mesolex: SYLARD does not acquire copyright of any material available through its portal.

If this is not possible, please contact the Mesolex: SYLARD director for alternative possibilities mesolex.director@gmail.com.</p><h3 class="sa_titulo_h3">Registration process</h3><p>Once a Collaborator has registered they will be contacted by Mesolex: SYLARD to plan the processing of their material.</p><h3 class="sa_titulo_h3">Responsibilities of Mesolex: SYLARD:</h3><p>Mesolex: SYLARD is a unit within Mesolex: Lexicosemantic Resources for Mesoamerican Languages, an initiative supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities to disseminate lexicons, grammars, and corpora of Mesoamerican language to a range of potential stakeholders: Indigenous communities and scholars, students and speakers; Western academics; and the general public. Ethical agreements with speakers and communities are the responsibility of the Collaborator who, by signing the Terms and Conditions for Collaborators, takes responsibility for working in an ethical manner and obtaining proper informed consent.</p><h3 class="sa_titulo_h3">Help document the utility of Mesolex: SYLARD</h3><p>Mesolex: SYLARD is a program to disseminate language documentation resources, in this case audio recordings annotated in ELAN. The developers of this tool, part of the Mesolex data portal and initiative, would greatly appreciate comments, suggestions, and reports on bugs as well as information on how SYLARD has been used to benefit endangered language documentation, description, and education. Please send all such comments to mesolex.director@gmail.com.<p></div>',
